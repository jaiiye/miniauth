_MiniAuth OAuth signature library in Java_


What is it?
---

MiniAuth is a stand-alone Java library for generating / verifying OAuth signatures (for OAuth 1.0a).


How to use it?
---

If you use Maven, you can build and (locally) install the *miniauth* library using standard Maven goals. Note that the project artefacts (jar files) have not been uploaded to any central Maven repository.
If you don't use Maven, then there is an ant script under `nomaven/scripts`.

Notes on JDK7
---

MiniAuth uses some of the JDK7 features such as "Switch with string values", "Multi-catch block", "Diamond operator", and "Try with resources", etc.
If you need to use an earlier version of JDK, then you may have to check out the source code and modify some parts.
